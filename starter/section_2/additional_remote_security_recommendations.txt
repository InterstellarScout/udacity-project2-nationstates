This is a list of reccomendations that you may follow to harden this server from attacks. They are sorted from most
extreme vulnerability to least.

this password gets changes to something unique and challenging. In addition, removing the user completely and adding an
account for every user is reccomended.

2) Lock the root account. The root account should be secured and inoperable, this way no hacker can use it to go into
the system.

a user attacking the device long term.
