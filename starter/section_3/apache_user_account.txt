# Provide the configuration lines you will update to ensure that Apache launches with group name as "apache-group" and user account as "apache-user".

Ubuntu Commands:
sudo groupadd apache-group
sudo useradd apache-user
sudo usermod â€“g apache-group -u apache-user

#Configuration lines:
The file modified is: /etc/apache2/envvars

Old Lines:
    # Since there is no sane way to get the parsed apache2 config in scripts, some
    # settings are defined via environment variables and then used in apache2ctl,
    # /etc/init.d/apache2, /etc/logrotate.d/apache2, etc.
    export APACHE_RUN_USER=www-data
    export APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-data


Replaced with:
