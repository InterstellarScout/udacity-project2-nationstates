Interstellar Security
Executive Summary

The company is hosting a device called "analysis-image." This device was found to be compromised though a variety of
different vectors. First and foremost, the device was infiltrated and infected with a virus that would boot and call
home every time the device was turned on. This gave the attacker a persistent means of accessing the network
unauthorized. This was mitigated by disabling the user that was created and removing the service and malware that was
left on the device. In addition, we found the original means of entry that was used to access the machine. Apache2 was
vulnerable, so we updated the servicesâ€™ permissions to what it needed the least to run, then prevented the machine from
advertising the software that is running on the device. This device is now safer than it was when we started.
